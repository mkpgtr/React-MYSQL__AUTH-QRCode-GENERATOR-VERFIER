## This work is done by Manish Panda & is a result of his original thinking & thought applied efforts.

1. USe dbStructure folder to lay out the mysql database structure. Otherwise the project won't work.


2. I am upload the dot env file on purpose so that anyone wanting to test this project can easily set it up without getting lost.

3. I may have missed a few error-handling edge-cases here & there.Yet, Looking at my code, you will know, that I have applied the concept.
